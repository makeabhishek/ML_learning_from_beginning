Before moving to Machine learning. Let us understand a little bit about curve fitting.
# Regression and model selection
Generally, the regression boils down to thinking about the equation $Ax=b$. We will look at this in terms of least squares fitting (LSQ).

The idea of regression is to think about fitting a model to a given data using some parameters. So we pick a model, we have input sets of data and we have a target. (output) and we fit the model.

## Overdetermined and under-determined system
When solving the system of equations $Ax=b$. Theses sytem of equations can be over determined or under determined.
