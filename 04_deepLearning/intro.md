## What is a Neural Network (NN)
Definition: (by Amazon web service) A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.

A scientific way of thinking about NN is that the NN's are flexible functions that fit the data. For example, NN takes some input, usually a vector $(x)$, which passes through a mathematical function. Here NN architecture defines the function and that architecture has some free parameter $(\theta)$, that we tune for the best output results, generated by the network. This output is also a vector $(y)$.
in general mathematics, the input-output relationships through function are defined as $y=f(x;\theta)$, whereas in NN this relationship is modified to $\hat{y} = NN(x;\theta)$

The training process of the network is to try and match the network's output with some training data by tuning the parameter $\theta$. For example, given some training points, fit the data. 

Goal: given training data, find a function (with flexible parameters $\theta$) which approximates the true function, $\hat{y} = NN(x;\theta) \approx y(x)$. Here $\theta$ is the free parameter (weights of NN).

### What is the NN function?
NN function depends on the architecture.
