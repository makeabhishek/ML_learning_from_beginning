#  Linear Classifiers

Classification of cats and dogs
Find the best linear classifier, which can classify any given animal as cat or dog based on two measurements, i.e., ear flappiness index and whisker length.

Aim:  Develop the best linear classifier. \
Let's start with the six steps we discussed in Chapter 1 \
### (1) Get Data. \

### (2) Think of the space of possible solutions. \

### (3) Characterize (objective) what makes a good solution: data preparation \

### (4) Find algorithm \

### (5) Run algorithm \

### (6) Validate results. \
