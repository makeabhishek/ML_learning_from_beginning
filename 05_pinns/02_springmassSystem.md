This is a classic physics problem, and we know that the underlying physics can be described by the following differential equation: \
$m \frac{d^2 u}{d x^2} + \mu \frac{d u}{d x} + ku = 0$ \

Where $m$ is the mass of the oscillator, $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction and $k$ is the spring constant.
