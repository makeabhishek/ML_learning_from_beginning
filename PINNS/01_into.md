### Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) 
PINNs are a class of deep learning models that incorporate physical laws, expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs), into the neural network training process. 
The idea is to guide the network to learn solutions that are consistent with both the observed data and the governing physical equations.

### Key Concepts of PINNs
#### 1. Integration of Physics:
PINNs integrate physical laws directly into the ``loss function``. This is achieved by ``encoding the differential equations as a penalty term`` that the neural network must satisfy, in addition to fitting any available data.

#### 2. Loss Function Components:
__(.) Data Loss__: Traditional loss based on the difference between the network's predictions and the observed data. This loss is used to train the model by updating its parameters to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and true values. 
There are several traditional loss types commonly used, depending on the nature of the problem (e.g., regression, classification). Common Types of Data Loss Functions used in NN are _Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss,
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Loss, Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss, Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss, Huber Loss_.

__(.) Physics Loss__: The discrepancy between the neural network's predictions and the differential equations representing the underlying physics. 

__(.) Boundary and Initial Condition Loss__: Enforces known conditions at the domain boundaries and initial time, if applicable. 

#### 3. Automatic Differentiation:

PINNs leverage ``automatic differentiation``, which is a feature of many deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This allows for the calculation of 
derivatives required by the PDEs and enables the network to be trained to satisfy these equations.

### Advantages:
__(.) Data Efficiency__: By incorporating physical knowledge, PINNs can often learn from fewer data points, as they are constrained by physics.

__(.) Generalization__: PINNs tend to generalize better to unseen conditions within the constraints of the physical model.

__(.) Handling Noisy Data__: PINNs can smooth out noise in data by relying on the underlying physics.

### Applications:
PINNs are used in various fields, including acoustics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, electromagnetics, structural mechanics, and beyond, where the underlying systems can be described by PDEs.

### How PINNs Work
Here's a high-level overview of how PINNs are typically implemented:

#### 1. Model Architecture:
A neural network (often fully connected) is designed to approximate the solution to the PDE. Inputs to the network are typically the spatial and temporal coordinates, while outputs are the field variables of interest.

#### 2. Training Process:
The network is trained using both observed data and the physics-based loss. During training, automatic differentiation is used to compute the required derivatives of the network output with respect to its inputs, which are then used to evaluate the physics loss.

#### 3. Optimization:
The optimization aims to minimize the combined loss, ensuring that the network predictions fit the observed data while also satisfying the PDEs as closely as possible.


### Example: Solving a Wave Equation
Consider the 2D wave equation:

$\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 (\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2})$

The PINN would be trained to minimize a loss function of the form: \
$Loss = \alpha \cdot DataLoss + \beta \cdot ||\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} - c^2 (\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2})||^2 + \gamma \cdot Boundary Condition loss$

__(.) Data Loss__: Ensures the model fits available data.

__(.) Physics Loss__: Penalizes deviations from the wave equation.

__(.) Boundary Condition Loss__: Ensures the model respects given boundary conditions.
