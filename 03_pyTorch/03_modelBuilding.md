# Pytorch debugging Techniques

- Debugging in PyTorch is essential for:
  - _Identifying Errors:_ Fixing bugs like incorrect tensor shapes, faulty operations, tenosrs in different devices (GPU or CPU).
  - _Ensuring Correctness:_ Verifying model implementation and component functionality.
  - _Optimizing Performance:_ Improving efficiency by identifying bottlenecks. Like improving loops
  - _Understanding Behavior:_ Gaining insights into layer interactions and data flow.
  - _Monitoring Training:_ Ensuring correct learning and making necessary adjustments.
  - _Improving Generalization:_ Addressing overfitting or underfitting issues. What optimizer cause overfitting and underfitting.
  - _Developing Custom Components:_ Ensuring custom layers or functions integrate correctly.
  - _Validating Results:_ Increasing confidence in model predictions and outputs.
- Debugging contributes to robust, efficient, and accurate PyTorch models.
