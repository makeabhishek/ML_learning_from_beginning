    "## Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts:\n",
    "A class can be thought of as a piece of code that specifies the data and behaviour that represent and model a particular type of object. We can write a fully functional class to model the real world. These classes help to better organize the code and solve complex programming problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class: \n",
    "- Objects\n",
    "- Data Abstraction \n",
    "- Encapsulation\n",
    "- Inheritance\n",
    "- Polymorphism\n",
    "- Dynamic Binding\n",
    "- Message Passing\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) A __class__ is a custom data type defined by the user, comprising data members and member functions. These can be accessed and utilized by creating an instance of the class. It encapsulates the properties and methods common to all objects of a specific type, serving as a blueprint for creating objects. __For Example:__ Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) An __object__ is an instance of a class. In OOP, an object is a fundamental unit that represents real-world entities. When a class is defined, it doesn't allocate memory, but memory is allocated when it is instantiated, meaning when an object is created. An object has an identity, state, and behaviour, and it contains both data and methods to manipulate that data. Objects can interact without needing to know the internal details of each other‚Äôs data or methods; it is enough to understand the type of messages they accept and the responses they return.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 'Dog' is a real-world object with characteristics such as colour, breed, and behaviours like barking, sleeping, and eating.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The term __methods__ refers to the different behaviours that objects will show. Methods are __functions__ that you define within a class. These functions typically operate on or with the attributes of the underlying instance or class. Attributes and methods are collectively referred to as members of a class or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) The term __attributes__ refers to the properties or data associated with a specific object of a given class. In Python, attributes are __variables__ defined inside a class to store all the required data for the class to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, __attributes__ are variables, while methods are __functions__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Inheritance:__ Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP. The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. When we write a class, we inherit properties from other classes. So when we create a class, we do not need to write all the properties and functions again and again, as these can be inherited from another class that possesses it. Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy."

    "```\n",
    "Let's break down the concepts of classes, including the ```__init__``` method, the ```forward``` method, and the ```super()``` function, which are essential for creating neural networks in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes in Python\n",
    "A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). Classes encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data, allowing for modular and reusable code. In the context of PyTorch, we use classes to define neural network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1. `__init__` Method \\\n",
    "The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes that acts as a constructor. It is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. This method is used to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a PyTorch neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Purpose:__ Initialize the layers of the neural network. \\\n",
    "__Usage:__ Define the layers as class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SimpleNN(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()  # Call the parent class's constructor\n",
    "        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)  # Initialize the first layer\n",
    "        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)   # Initialize the second layer\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. `forward Method` \\\n",
    "The `forward method` defines the forward pass of the neural network. It specifies how the input data should flow through the network's layers to produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Purpose:__ Define the computation performed at every call. \\\n",
    "__Usage:__ Apply layers and activation functions to the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input to forward: `x` is passed as an argument to the forward method. It represents the input data being fed into the neural network. x is transfom=rmed by each layer in the network. The final `x` after processing through the network is the output of the forward method, representing the network's predictions for the given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "def forward(self, x):\n",
    "    x = self.layer1(x)  # Pass input through the first layer\n",
    "    x = self.relu(x)    # Apply ReLU activation function\n",
    "    x = self.layer2(x)  # Pass through the second layer\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `super()` Function \\\n",
    "The `super()` function is used to call methods from a parent or superclass. This is particularly useful in object-oriented programming to ensure that the parent class's methods are called and initialized properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Purpose:__ Call the constructor of the parent class `(nn.Module)`. \\\n",
    "__Usage:__ Ensure that the PyTorch nn.Module is initialized correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self):\n",
    "    super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()  # Initialize the parent class\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "`__init__`: Initializes the network's layers. \\\n",
    "`forward`: Defines the data flow through the network. \\\n",
    "`super()`: Calls the parent class's methods to ensure proper initialization. \\\n"

    "- Typically when we create a class we create a method that is known as a constructor. A constructor is what will be called automatically when we create a new instance of that class. To create a constructor we must use the method name init(). We do not need to call this method by doing something like \"instance.init()\" because when we first create a Dog object it will be automatically called.\n",
    "- __init__ is called the constructor method.  __init__ genrallys needts to be in every classes. If we wnat anything to be happen initially. We use that\n",
    "- What happens: when we create new object\n",
    "    - example: `tim = Dog()` the method `__init__` is automatically get fired or going to happen. W donot have to say `tim.__init__`\n",
    "    - Lets say everytime if I create an object of Dog()  I want to print `print('Nice you made a dog!')`\n",

    "    - __attributes__ are kind of variables that belocng to certain object\n",
    "    - To create an attribute we have to use `self` keyword. This keyword stands for the instance you are calling for.\n",
    "    - Example: `tim = Dog()`, here `tim` is an instance of type `Dog()`. `fred` is another instance of type Dog()\n",

So if we put a parameter in `__init__` i.e., `name`. So now we have to pass the parameter when we create `Dog()`. Just like functions we can give multiple parameters. For example `__init__(self, name, age, color, kind)`.\n",

It is beaue `self` is always neeed to be here except only for specific cases. i.e., when we are calling `tim = Dog()` it gintg at the `self` so its `self.name=name` becomes `tim.name=name`.\n",

They cannot change or look at any object attributes or call other methods within the class. They can be thought of as a special kind of function that sits inside of the class.

    "### Answers\n",
    "1 - Using classes v/s functions is sometimes just a matter of preference, but there are some use cases where classes greatly simplify the code.  Using classes allows you to hide a lot of complexity in the class definition so that implementation is simpler.  This shows up especially when you have graphic user interfaces, plots, and interfaces with complex entities like databases.  Writing a class also allows you to implement special behaviors for your object;  for instance if you want two instances of your object to work with the ‚Äò+‚Äô operator, you can write the `__add__` method for your class.  There are times when that is a big help.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Being a ‚Äúfirst class object‚Äù in Python is really a way of saying that data types that you write (classes) have the same status as the data types that are a part of the language.  In some other languages, the built-in types are __‚Äúfirst class‚Äù__ and behave differently from user-created types.  All objects in Python are ‚Äúfirst class objects‚Äù, meaning they are created at runtime, they can be passed around and assigned names, and they can be stored in data structures.  In fact, functions are just special kinds of objects in Python that have a `__call__` method defined.  You can rename them, store them, pass them, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - These are some mechanics of classes in Python:\n",
    "`__init__(self)` is called any time a new instance of a class is created.  self is the name we typically use for the instance, so every method of a class always gets a reference to the instance so that it can modify itself.  It‚Äôs not strictly necessary to call it self, but that is the convention.  An exception to this is a class method, which is created by putting @classmethod on the line above the method definition.  In that case, we typically call the first argument cls because that will be a reference to the class itself instead of the instance.\n",
    "super() is a function that returns a reference to the parent class.  So if you have one class inheriting from another, and you want to call a method that is defined on the parent class (this is typically done for `__init__`), then a call to super() returns the parent class.  Python currently does not recognize or do anything special with a `__super__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "mean by ‚Äúfirst class object‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the idea is to compare with other languages such as C/C++, Fortran and Java, where you can define functions but you can‚Äôt, for example, assign them as values for variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, or otherwise use them as you would other named values (C/C++ has the notion of a ‚Äúfunction pointer‚Äù which is close, but not quite ‚Äúfirst-class‚Äù).  In these languages, functions aren‚Äôt \"first-class‚Äù values or objects because they are restricted or special in the way they are treated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Tim noted, a function in Python is just another type of object, alongside ints, floats, strings, lists, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other languages which use functions as first-class objects, notably the ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù programming languages like Lisp, Scheme and Haskell. But most new (~10-20 years old) programming languages support the concept of first class functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you found the course really useful, now that you‚Äôre several months out from taking it."
