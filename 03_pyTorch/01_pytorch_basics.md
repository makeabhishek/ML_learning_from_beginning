## 1. Overview
Pytorch was developed by Facebook AI. But now owned by pytorch foundation (like Linux)

We should consider to learn
1.	Basics of PyTorch tensors and computational graphs
2.	Implement deep learning models with custom data loaders and preprocessing techniques using PyTorch.
3.	Understand GPU and CPU utilization and PyTorch software infrastructure

### Why to use PyTorch? It's advantages:
1.	Easy to use GPU computational power without going deep into hardware and memory.
2.	Automatic differentiation (AD): Compiled computational graph. We use AD, which is a modular way of computing automatic differentiation. We do it either by compiling computational graph or we use dynamical computational graph. PyTorch uses dynamical computational graph is faster and dynamically changing the graph instead of using single graph for everything.
3.	PyTorch Ecosystem: Tochvision, torchtext, torchaudio.Parallel computing, model deployement.

## 2. Tensor Basics
- Tensors can run on GPUâ€™s unlike numPy array. \

### Tensor Initialization
Before we write the code in PyTorch, lets look how can we initialise the tensors. Here I show four different ways to initilise tensor. Tensor can have any dimension i.e, 1D, 2D, nD. We can initilise the tensor in cpu or gpu, we can initlise based on data type, for example `float`, `long`
- From Numpy: convert using `torch.Tensor` 
- Using torch.Tensor(). we can create a list or list of list or dictionary of list.
- Using random
- Using zeros_like and Ones_like

- Tensors are a core PyTorch data type similar to a multidimensional array (like in Numpy). For example the image shown below can be represented in RGB channel with width and height. The tensore representaion of this image can be written as [3, 224, 224].
- Use for representing data in numerical way
- Tensors can run on GPUs unlike Numpy's array

**Create an empty tensor** \
Notice the size of tensors in the output
```
#  Create an empty tensor of size 1, so it is a scalar. Do not initialise the value. \
>>> x = torch.empty(1)
>>> print(x)
tensor([0.])
#  Create an empty tensor of size 3, so it is a 1D vector.
>>> x = torch.empty(3)
>>> print(x)
tensor([0., 0., 0.])
#  Create an empty tensor of size 2,3, so it is a 2D matrix.
>>> x = torch.empty(2, 3)
>>> print(x)
tensor([[0., 0., 0.],
        [0., 0., 0.]])
# similarly for 3D
>>> x = torch.empty(2,2, 3)
>>> print(x)
tensor([[[0., 0., 0.],
         [0., 0., 0.]],

        [[0., 0., 0.],
         [0., 0., 0.]]])
```
**Genrate numbers or tensors**
```
x= torch.arange(12)
print(x)
# Check the type of tensor
print(type(x))
# Check the dimension of tensor
print(x.shape)         # we dont use () because its a property not a function
# Check the number off elements in 
x.numel()        # total number of elements in one axis
```
**Generate random numbers** 
```
x = torch.rand(2,2)
print(x)
```
**Generate random numbers with noraml distribution, which foloow standard Gaussian Distribution with mean 0 and STD 1** 
```
torch.randn(3,4)
```
**Using zeros and Ones**
```
>>> x = torch.zeros(2,2)
>>> print(x)
tensor([[0., 0.],
        [0., 0.]])

>>> x = torch.ones(2,2)
>>> print(x)
tensor([[1., 1.],
        [1., 1.]])

# Multidimensional tensor. Lets define 3 dimentional tensor. 
y= torch.zeros((2,3,4))
print(y)         # check the paranthesis
# access the elements
y[0]        # extract elemtn from 1st axis

z = torch.ones((2,3,4))
print(z)
```

### Tensor manipulation
Once we initilise the tensor we can perform differnt type of manipulations on tensors. It can be in three different ways,
- Element-wise operations: if we have two tensor `a` and `b` we can multiply them `a*b`
- Functional operations: we can use pytorch function like `torch.matmul`, `torch.nn.functional.relu`
- Modular operations: this is a object oriented way of performing same functional operations. For example, if we want to pass an image as a convolutional filter then we can create a module for conv filter. That module can be used to perform filtering, whcih comes an output of that module.

__Why need to worry about tensor manipulation__
The reason to consider a particular tensor manipulation is important because of __computational graph__. \
Often when we talk about deep learning or neural networks, we need to optimize for the __weights__ and __biases__ using __forward__ and __backward propagation__. When we perform forward and backward propagation, we need to get __gradient__. To obtain the gradients we need to store a record of different tensors and different operations that we have performed using directed acyclic graph (DAG).

**Check tensor data type and modify it**
```
>>> x = torch.ones(2,2)
>>> print(x.dtype)
torch.float32  # this is default
>>> x = torch.ones(2,2, dtype=torch.int)
>>>  print(x.dtype)
>>> x = torch.ones(2,2, dtype=torch.double)
>>>  print(x.dtype)
>>> x = torch.ones(2,2, dtype=torch.float16)
>>>  print(x.dtype)
```
**Reshape Tensor**
```
X = x.reshape(3,4) # number of elements must be same
# We can see after reshaping that we have extra [], because of an extra axis
print(X.shape)         # first axis has 3 elements and 2nd axis has 4 elements. 0th axis is the column (y direction)
```

**Check the shape, size of Tensor**
```
print(x.shape())
print(x.size())
```

**Creating Tensor from Python List** 
```
torch.tensor([[2,1,4,3],[1,2,3,4],[4,3,2,1]])
```
**Element wise operations** 
```
x= torch.tensor([1.0, 2, 4, 8])
y = torch.tensor([2, 2, 2, 2])
x+y, x-y, x*y, x/y,x**y
torch.exp(x)
```

**Concatenate tensor** 
```
X = torch.arange(12, dtype=torch.flat32).reshape((3,4))
Y = torch.tensor([[2.0, 1, 4, 3],[1, 2, 3, 4],[4, 3, 2, 1]])
X,Y
X.shape, Y.shape

torch.cat((X,Y),dim=0) # Concatenate in y direction or column wise
torch.cat((X,Y),dim=1) # Concatenate in x direction or column wise
```
**Other operations**
```
X.sum()         # Summing all the elements in the tensor yields a tensor with only one element
X.sum().shape        # we will not see any number, this mean
X.sum(dim=0)
X.sum(dim=0, keepdim=True)
X.sum(dim=0).shape
X.shum(dim=0, keepdim=True).shape
```

**Perform elementwise operations by invooking the braodcasting mechanism**
```
a = torch.arange(3).reshape((3,1))
b = torch.arange(2).reshape((1,2))
a,b
# we cannot do element wise operation as the size is not same. But we can do this using broadcasting. In braodcasting we make the replica of row or column to make the two tensors of same shape.

a+b
```
**Indexing and assignment**
```
X = torch.arange(12, dtype=torch.flat32).reshape((3,4))
X[0]         # the tensor has two axis. If we just index one number , we are indexing based on 0-axis
X[-1]        # index for last set of element
# Assignment
X[1:3] =12
```

**Memory Usage in Pytorch**
```
# Assign the results of an operation to a previously allocated array with slice notation
print('id(X):', id(X))        # id function can be used, whcih give a pointer and memory where tensor is stored
X[:] = X + Y
print('id(X):', id(X))

print('id(X):', id(X))
X += + Y
print('id(X):', id(X))

X[:] = X + Y
X = X + Y
print('id(X):', id(X)) # now we will have different memory
```

**Convert numpy array to torch tensor and viceversa**
```
A =  X.numpy()                # tensor to numpy
B = torch.from_numpy(A)       # tensor from numpy
type(A), type(B)
```

## 3. Gradinet Calculation with autograd
Differentiation is a crucial step in nearly all machine learning and deep learning optimization algorithms. While the calculations for taking these derivatives are straightforward, working out the updates by hand can be a tedious task. We will get a conceptual understanding of 
how __autograd__ works to find the __gradient__ of multivariable functions. \
We will discuss some fundamentals on _derivatives_, _partial derivatives_, _gradients_, and _Jacobians_. We then discuss how to compute _gradients_ using ```requires_grad=True``` and the ```backward()``` method. 
Thus, we cover ```classes``` and ```functions``` implementing __automatic differentiation__ of arbitrary scalar-valued and non-scalar-valued functions. We also discuss the _Jacobian matrix_ in PyTorch. 

### Computational Graph
We discussed in above section, how computational graphs are generated in PyTorch.

- NN optimize weights and biases using forward and backward propagation.
- Deep learnign graphs record tensors and operations in directed acyclic graph (DAG). An example of DAG  is shown in the figure below, where `x`, and `y` are input tensors, which goes into multiplication operation, gives `v`, whcih is then passed to `log`, gives `w`. here multiplication is an element-wise operation, then `log` is a functional oeration. \
In tensorflow these graphs are compiled apriori to start of DL or NN training, whereas,
- PyTorch uses dynamic graphs, built at runtime for efficiency. So because of dynamic graph code actually becomes the graph.
- In the graph, nodes represent operations (functions) and edges represents the tensors.

- Computational graphs are useful in creating `Autograd`. The way it is done that once we build the graph dynamically during tensor operation and recorded all the dependencies. We can now use this dynamic computation graph to compute the gradients for the tensors by travelling in the graph in backward direction. This is performed using __Chain Rule__. Once we compute the backward propagation using chain rule, we get the gradients and once we have have the gradients, the optimization of parameters during model training can go.

### Autograd and Backpropagation
- Automatic differentiation library that facilitates the computation of gradients for tensor operations.
- Dynamic Computational Graph: Builds graph dynamically during tensor operations, recording dependencies. Backward Propagation: Traverses graph backward to compute gradients for tensors
- Gradient Calculation: Computes gradients efficiently, optimizing parameters during model training.
- Ease of Use: Simplifies training loops, automating gradient computation for developers.

**Autograd Example**
Here is an example, how forward anf backward pass works. \
We can compute $\frac{\partial w}{\partial v}$, which is a log derivative. Once we have log derivative, we can compute $\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}$, whcih is mult derivative, as long as we knwo the way to compute the derivative for multiplication operation.

## 4. Gradient Descent with Autograd









## classes 
If you define a function inside a class, itâ€™s called a __method__. Methods are used by instances of a class.

```
class Demo:
  def method(self):
    print(â€˜testâ€™)

demo = Demo()
demo.method()
# this line above is shorthand for this:
Demo.method(self=demo)
```
