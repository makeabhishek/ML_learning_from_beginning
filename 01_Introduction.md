Example: I'll start by thinking about the example related to ML. Let's take the course (mathematics) we are taking in our undergraduate curriculum. The professor gave notes, teaching material, and homework. This is training data. Now test data will be your examination and you will check how well you perform. Validation data can be assignments that you get during teaching.

## The objective of ML
_Make decisions or predictions based on data_

## Pipeline (six steps) to make ML application work:
Humans have to do the following task except task (5), which computers do. \
(1) Get Data (do prediction not only do data processing). \
(2) Think of the space of possible solutions. (e.g. linear relationship, polynomial, etc.) \
(3) Characterize (objective) what makes a good solution: data preparation e.g., loss function.\
(4) Find algorithm. e.g., Choose the best option that reduces the loss through optimization, based on steps 2 and 3. \
(5) Run algorithm (only part done by computer) \
(6) Validate results. \


## AI - ML - DL - DS (or data analysis)

## Types of problems to be solved by using ML
(1) Estimation or prediction: Prediction within data range \
(2) Generalization: Future prediction, forecasting

## Classification of ML
### (1) Supervised Learning \
Given some input and output data, we learn the mapping so that in future we can use this mapping function to predict the output for a given input. It is called supervised because we have given both questions and answers to the ML model.
Example: \
Image classification of different animals. \
Binary classification, detecting tumour or not. \


(i) Classification \
Test your data to classify online using (1) Teachable Machine for Image Classification: \ 
[teachable machine]([https://website-name.com](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) 'Classification')

(ii) Regression \


### (2) Unsupervised Learning \
Learn from the data. No answers or labels to the data. For example, Amazon product suggestions.

### (3) Reinforcement Learning \
