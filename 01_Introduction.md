Example: I'll start by thinking about the example related to ML. Lets take the course (mathematics) we are taking in our undergrduate curriculum. The professor gave as notes, teaching material, and homework.
## The objective of ML
_Make decisions or predictions based on data_

## Important (six) steps to make ML application work:
Humans have to do the following task except task (5), which computers do. \
(1) Get Data (do prediction not only do data processing) \
(2) Think of the space of possible solutions \
(3) Characterize (objective) what makes a good solution: data preparation \
(4) Find algorithm \
(5) Run algorithm (only part done by computer) \
(6) Validate results. \


## AI - ML - DL - DS (or data analysis)

## Types of problems to be solved by using ML
(1) Estimation or prediction: Prediction within data range \
(2) Generalization: Future prediction, forecasting

## Classification of ML
### Supervised Learning \
Given some input and output data, we learn the mapping so that in future we can use this mapping function to predict the output for a given input. It is called supervised because we have given both questions and answers to the ML model.
Example: \
Image classification of different animals. \
Binary classification, detecting tumour or not. \


(i) Classification \
Test your data to classify online using (1) Teachable Machine for Image Classification: \ 
[teachable machine]([https://website-name.com](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) 'Classification')
(ii) Regression \


### Unsupervised Learning \
Learn from the data. No answers or labels to the data. For example, Amazon product suggestions.

### Reinforcement Learning \
