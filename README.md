This is a repository which I'm using to document my learning or revisiting machine learning course. I'll markdown all the necessary details here. Please note that I'm not teaching any course, however learning or revisiting the ML course.

__Machine learning is the process of building models from data using optimization techniqes.__

### Important steps to implement ML 

1. Decide the problem: what are we modelling?
2. Curate Data: What data will inform the model?
3. Design an architecture: basically a cfunction to predict relation between input and output. Example: RNN, Autoencoder, DMD, SINDy, etc.
4. Craft a Loss function: what models are "good"?
5. Employ optimization: What algoriths to train the model?

Optimization (step 5) is used to tune the parameters of the NN architechture (step 3) to minimize loss funciton (step 4), averaged over training data (step 2).
